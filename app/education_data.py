# Education content, kept out of __init__.py so teammates can add degrees
# without touching route or template logic (same pattern as work_history_data.py).
#
# Each member has a list of degrees, newest first. Each degree needs:
#   - institution:  school name
#   - degree:       degree type and field (e.g. "B.S. Computer Science")
#   - dates:        human-readable date range
#   - location:     where the school is based
#   - gpa:          optional GPA string
#   - highlights:   list of short bullet strings (awards, clubs, relevant coursework, etc.)
#   - link:         optional {"label", "url"} for the school or program
